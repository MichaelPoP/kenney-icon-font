Kenney Icon Font
================
> Version: 0.1.0 (Alpha)<br />
> Author: Kenney.NL, SamBrishes

The Kenney IconFont is specifically designed for browser games. This Icon Font uses the 
[Game Icons](http://kenney.nl/assets/game-icons) and the 
[Game Icons Expansion](http://kenney.nl/assets/game-icons-expansion) Packs, which are developed by 
[Kenney.nl](http://kenney.nl). Both Icon-Packs were published under the CC0 license!

Content
-------
The current version of the Kenney Icon Font contains **200 icons**, so all available icons from the 
2 mentioned packages above + 13 (or more?) modified / designed icons from myself. I'm not the best 
Vector-Designer, but i will try to add more icons in the future. (Want to request an Icon? Create 
an Issue [here](https://github.com/SamBrishes/kenney-icon-font/issues)).

#### First Alpha Version
This is the first Alpha Version, which may contains some errors. Please note also, that some single 
parts of the icon pack can / will change in future releases.

Demonstration
-------------
You can view all icons on this [GitHub Page](http://sambrishes.github.io/kenney-icon-font). (The 
demonstration page is still under construction, I will improve the site soon).
